    "# Generating Text using an LSTM Network (No libraries)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll train an LSTM network built in pure numpy to generate Eminem lyrics. LSTMs are a fairly simple extension to neural networks, and they're behind a lot of the amazing achievements deep learning has made in the past few years.\n",

    "## What is a Recurrent Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent nets are cool, they're useful for learning sequences of data. Input. Hidden state. Output. \n",

    "It has a weight matrix that connects input to hidden state. But also a weight matrix that connects hidden state to hidden state at previous time step.\n",
    "![alt text](https://iamtrask.github.io/img/basic_recurrence_singleton.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "So we could even think of it as the same feedforward network connecting to itself overtime (unrolled) since passing in\n",
    "not just input in next training iteration but input + previous hidden state\n",

    "If we want to predict the last word in the sentence \"The grass is green\", that's totally doable. \n",
    "![alt text](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/RNN-shorttermdepdencies.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we want to predict the last word in the sentence \"I am French (2000 words later) i speak fluent French\". We need to be able to remember long range dependencies. RNN's are bad at this. They forget the long term past easily.\n",
    "![alt text](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/RNN-longtermdependencies.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the \"Vanishing Gradient Problem\". The Gradient exponentially decays as its backpropagated\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two factors that affect the magnitude of gradients - the weights and the activation functions (or more precisely, their derivatives) that the gradient passes through.If either of these factors is smaller than 1, then the gradients may vanish in time; if larger than 1, then exploding might happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there exists a solution! Enter the LSTM Cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The LSTM Cell (Long-Short Term Memory Cell)\n",
    "\n",
    "We've placed no constraints on how our model updates, so its knowledge can change pretty chaotically: at one frame it thinks the characters are in the US, at the next frame it sees the characters eating sushi and thinks they're in Japan, and at the next frame it sees polar bears and thinks they're on Hydra Island. \n",
    "\n",
    "This chaos means information quickly transforms and vanishes, and it's difficult for the model to keep a long-term memory. So what youâ€™d like is for the network to learn how to update its beliefs (scenes without Bob shouldn't change Bob-related information, scenes with Alice should focus on gathering details about her), in a way that its knowledge of the world evolves more gently.\n",
    "\n",
    "It replaces the normal RNN cell and uses an input, forget, and output gate. As well as a cell state\n",
    "![alt text](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohsen_Fayyaz/publication/306377072/figure/fig2/AS:398082849165314@1471921755580/Fig-2-An-example-of-a-basic-LSTM-cell-left-and-a-basic-RNN-cell-right-Figure.ppm \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://kijungyoon.github.io/assets/images/lstm.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "These gates each have their own set of weight values. The whole thing is differentiable (meaning we compute gradients and update the weights using them) so we can backprop through it\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our model to be able to know what to forget, what to remember. So when new a input comes in, the model first forgets any long-term information it decides it no longer needs. Then it learns which parts of the new input are worth using, and saves them into its long-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "And instead of using the full long-term memory all the time, it learns which parts to focus on instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we need mechanisms for forgetting, remembering, and attention. That's what the LSTM cell provides us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas a vanilla RNN uses one equation to update its hidden state/memory:\n",

    "\n",
    "Which piece of long term memory to remember and forget? \n",
    "We'll use new input and working memory to learn remember gate. \n",
    "Which part of new data should we use and save? \n",
    "Update working memory using attention vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The long-term memory, is usually called the cell state, \n",
    "- The working memory, is usually called the hidden state. This is analogous to the hidden state in vanilla RNNs.\n",
    "- The remember vector, is usually called the forget gate (despite the fact that a 1 in the forget gate still means to keep the memory and a 0 still means to forget it),\n",
    "- The save vector, is usually called the input gate (as it determines how much of the input to let into the cell state), \n",
    "- The focus vector, is usually called the output gate )\n",

    "The most popular application right now is actually in natural language processing\n",
    "which involves sequential data such as words,  sentences, sound spectrogram, etc. So applications with translation,  sentiment analysis,  text generation, etc. \n",
